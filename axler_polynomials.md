p = sq + r
	proof: show linear map is bijective

every zero is a one degree factor
	p(z) = (z - lambda) q(z)

a polynomial has at most zeros as its degree
	proof: induction using one degree factor theorem

fundamental theorem of algrebra: every nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients has a zero
	p has a unique factorization

can factorize polynomial over C to single degree terms
	proof: induction
		using fundamental theorem: zero always exists
		one degree factor

if lambda is a root then complex conjugate of lambda is also a root
	proof: plug lambda into polynomial = 0
		take complex conjugate of both sides

can factorize polynomail over R to one and two degree terms
	proof: induction
		at each step can take out either single degree term with real root
		OR term with complex root AND its conjugate
			its coefficients are real, so the polynomial that's left will still have real coefficients

random facts
	multiplicity can result in num roots <= num degree
