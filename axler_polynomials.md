## Polynomials
p = sq + r
- proof: show linear map is bijective

Every zero is a one degree factor
- p(z) = (z - lambda) q(z)

A polynomial has at most zeros as its degree
- proof: induction using one degree factor theorem

**Fundamental theorem of algrebra**: every nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients has a zero
- p has a unique factorization

Can factorize polynomial over C to single degree terms
- proof: induction
	- using fundamental theorem: zero always exists
	- one degree factor

If lambda is a root then complex conjugate of lambda is also a root
- proof: plug lambda into polynomial = 0
	- take complex conjugate of both sides

Can factorize polynomail over R to one and two degree terms
- proof: induction
	- at each step can take out either single degree term with real root
	- OR term with complex root AND its conjugate
		- its coefficients are real, so the polynomial that's left will still have real coefficients

Random facts
- multiplicity can result in num roots <= num degree
